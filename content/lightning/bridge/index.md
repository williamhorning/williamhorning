# the lightning bridge

If you've ever had a community, chances are you talk to them in many places,
whether that's Discord, Guilded, Revolt, or Telegram. Over time, you end up
with fragmentation as your community grows and changes, with many people using
multiple messaging apps. People eventually grow tired of the differences
between apps, and switching between them, with things becoming a mess.

You could *try* to move everyone to one app, but that might alienate people, so
what do you do, what options do you have?

**Bridging!** Everyone can use their favorite app, gets the same messages, and
is on the same page. Lightning is an easy to use bridge bot that supports
Discord, Guilded, Revolt, and Telegram. To get started, check out the
[getting started guide](./users), which will walk you through using
Bolt, the hosted version of the Lightning bot. If you want to self-host, read
the [self-hosting guide](./hosting) to get started.
