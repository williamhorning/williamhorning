# Hosting Lightning

Lightning is pretty easy to host, with it taking a few steps:

1. [Configuring a database](./hosting/database) and [Plugins](./hosting/plugins)
2. [Configuring Lightning](./hosting/configuration)
3. [Legacy Migrations (optional)](./hosting/legacy-migrations)
4. [Hosting with Deno](./hosting/deno) or
   [Hosting with Docker](./hosting/docker)
