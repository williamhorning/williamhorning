# Hosting Lightning

Lightning is pretty easy to host, with it taking a few steps:

1. [Configuring a database](database) and [Plugins](plugins)
2. [Configuring Lightning](configuration)
3. [Legacy Migrations (optional)](legacy-migrations)
4. [Hosting with Deno](deno) or [Hosting with Docker](docker)
