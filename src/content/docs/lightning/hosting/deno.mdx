# Hosting with Deno

:::tip
In production environments, you may want to use [Docker](../docker) instead
:::

It's possible to host Lightning using Deno. This approach allows you to avoid
the complexity associated with container-based setups but limits your ability to
isolate the bot from your host environment.

## Installing Prerequisites

### Deno

First, you must install Deno:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="MacOS / Linux" icon="seti:shell">
		```sh
		curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
		```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="Windows" icon="seti:windows">
		```powershell
		irm https://deno.land/install.ps1 | iex
		```
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### your database

After you install Deno, you'll need to install a database. See
[_database options_](../database) for more information on choosing and setting
up a database to use with Lightning

## Installing Lightning

Once you have the necessary prerequisites installed, you can run the following
command to install the `lightning` cli:

```sh
deno install -g jsr:@lightning/lightning@0.8.0-alpha.5
```

### Configuring lightning

When you have lightning installed, you should make a `lightning.toml` file with the
necessary configuration for your database and plugins. See
[_configuration_](../configuration) and [_plugins_](../plugins)

### Running Lightning

You can run lightning by using the `lightning run` command
